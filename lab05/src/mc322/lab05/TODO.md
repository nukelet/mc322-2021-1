## Bugs
- Captured pieces are not being removed from the board (**fixed**)

## Implement
- Pawns need to get promoted upon reaching the opposite side of the board (**done**)
- Maybe have a Game class that encapsulates the Board operations?
- Make pieces unable to capture other pieces of the same color
- Maybe make sure that a piece is forced to capture if there are pieces available to be captured
