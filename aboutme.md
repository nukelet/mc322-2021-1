# About me
My name is Vin√≠cius Peixoto. I'm a 19 year-old Electrical Engineering undergrad at the Campinas State University (Unicamp).

## Projects

### Phoenix Robotics Team
I'm currently a member of the Autonomous Projects department at the [Phoenix Robotics Team](https://www.phoenixunicamp.com.br), where we focus on developing autonomous robots (as well as the computational systems that power them) for various robotics competitions at national and international level.
The two projects I'm working on at the moment are:
+ **Piranha**, a self-driven robot for the _Trekking_ category that has to complete a course, passing through a set of white bases (located using a Computer Vision system) as fast as possible
+ **PhoenixEleven**, an autonomous football team for the _2D Soccer Simulation_ category, where two teams compete against each other in a simulation of a real soccer match in which each player is an individual agent that has limited communication to the other players and receives imperfect (limited/noisy) information about the environment.

### Other personal projects
Some other projects I'm working on, although at a slow pace, are:
+ [AstraBot](https://github.com/nukelets/AstraBot), a Discord bot that will help manage the [r/Language_Exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/language_exchange/) Discord [server](https://discord.gg/languageexchange)
+ [cpp-nes](https://github.com/nukelets/cpp-nes), a NES emulator written in C++
+ [simple-pascal](https://github.com/nukelets/simple-pascal), a basic Pascal interpreter written in Python.

## Interests

My primary interests are machine learning and artificial intelligence (particularly in the context of multiagent systems).
Recently, I've been really interested in computer architecture and emulation/virtualization as well.
I've also been exploring Linux (particularly Arch Linux) a lot, and trying to learn how to use Vim productively.

Other than that, I'm really interested in Linguistics and Language Learning, as well as Cognitive Science and Philosophy in general.
I enjoy listening to all kinds of music, but lately I've been fixated on Chinese/Japanese math rock (you should check out [this](https://youtu.be/PGB6BDN86Kw) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQh4RMwKsFI)). I also play Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 sometimes.
